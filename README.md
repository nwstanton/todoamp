This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to create a todo list using Next.js, tailwind css, typescript and aws amplify.

## The Stack

**Next.js:** My Framework of choice is Next.js because it is built on top of React, an in demand and well documented technology. 
The SEO firendly rendering methods built in handle many of the common problems with single page applications have with SEO and I belive this will be an important skill to have in the coming years as a web dev.

**Typescript:** Just like everyone says "It helps me catch bugs in dev before they hit production.". It is also easier to collaborate with others and manage my objects while my program grows in complexity.

**Tailwind:** Although inline styleing is a contegious subject, tailwind allows me to quickly and easily impliment styles on smaller applications like this one. Tailwind does not scale well with larger teams and applications, but refactoring to sass or a theme manager is pretty easy, and my styles are not tied to somthing like material ui.

**AWS Amplify:** AWS is the most used service provider and using their backend as a service, Amplify, gives me the ability to quickly impliment a rudimentary backend to interact with and build layers of complexity on top of. One of the main goals of this project is to experiment with GraphQL as amplify has it out of the box.
